       link ?-sym? srcpath destpath

              Create  a  directory entry, destpath, linking it to the existing
              file, srcpath.  If -sym is specified, a  symbolic  link,  rather
              than  a  hard link, is created.  (The -sym option is only avail-
              able on systems that support symbolic links.)

              The link command is not available on Windows.  Use the Tcl  8.4+
              file link command instead.
