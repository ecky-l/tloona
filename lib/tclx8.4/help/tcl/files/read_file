       read_file ?-nonewline? fileName

       read_file fileName numBytes
              This  procedure reads the file fileName and returns the contents
              as a string.  If -nonewline is specified, then the last  charac-
              ter  of  the  file  is discarded if it is a newline.  The second
              form specifies exactly how many bytes will be read and returned,
              unless  there are fewer than numBytes bytes left in the file; in
              this case, all the remaining bytes are returned.
