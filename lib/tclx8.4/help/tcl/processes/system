       system cmdstr1 ?cmdstr2...?
              Concatenates   cmdstr1,   cmdstr2 etc with space separators (see
              the concat command) into a single command and then evaluates the
              command  using the standard system shell.  On Unix systems, this
              is /bin/sh and on Windows its command.com.  The exit code of the
              command is returned.

              This  command  differs  from  the  exec  command  in that system
              doesn't return the executed command's  standard  output  as  the
              result string, and system goes through the Unix shell to provide
              wild card expansion, redirection, etc, as is normal from  an  sh
              command line.
